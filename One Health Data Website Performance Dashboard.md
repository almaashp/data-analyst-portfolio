“One Health Data Website” is a platform which Ministry of Health utilize to centralized health data in form of Dashboard and Dataset for public and private use. While the One Health Data Website platform offers data transparency from central government to regional and organizational stakeholders, this dashboard aims to monitor and evaluate “One Health Data Website” performance which divided into 2 main focus: Dashboard and User.

The first thing depicted in this dashboard is overall condition of Dashboard information in the website. It started with scorecards to show aggregate value of total dashboard embedded, total visit dashboard, and total shared dashboard. To analyze dashboard utilization and identify unexpected occurrence, it provides daily dashboard visit trend and its median to determine average daily visit without effected by unusual trend (like what happened on February 2024). Moreover, there is summary table to show summary information of each dashboard with daily visit trend per dashboard and total visit distribution per dashboard topics to support the decision making process.

Subsequentially, second segment of this dashboard is the User Overview where it shows aggregate information regarding users registration and activation in scorecards. Following that, is a time series of user’s funnel, portraying potential gap between each journey. In what is seen below, the gap between users who registered and those who actually approved and activated (logged in) is profound. It can caused an curiosity for decision makers and force them to analyze the business process of the platform further.
