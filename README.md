I have experience in various domains, including healthcare, education, and marketing. My work involves using advanced analytical techniques and tools to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within large datasets. I am particularly interested in understanding how data exclusions and inequalities impact societies and policymaking, and I strive to leverage data to promote equitable solutions.
