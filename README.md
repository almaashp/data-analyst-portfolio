# Data Analytics Portfolio
This repository showcases a selection of my data analytics projects, highlighting my skills and experience in analyzing and visualizing data to generate insights and support decision-making.

## About Me
Hi, I'm Almaash! I am a data enthusiast with a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive decision-making and innovation since 2021. I have experience in various domains, including healthcare, education, and marketing. My work involves using advanced analytical techniques and tools to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within large datasets. I am particularly interested in understanding how data exclusions and inequalities impact societies and policymaking, and I strive to leverage data to promote equitable solutions.
